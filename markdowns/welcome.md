# Functional Web Framework

Web flux is one of the new things brought by Spring 5. It has been designed as a microframework for web applications. 
Here microframework means: 
* Concise - no boilerplate, no setup
* Simple - no magic
* Easy to deploy - single deployment artifact
* Easy to run - no extra dependencies
* Lightweight - minimal memory / CPU footprint
* Non-blocking - for better concurrency

Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about adding programming exercises within your contribution.
